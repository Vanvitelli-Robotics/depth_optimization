# Depth Optimizer
This is a ROS2 node to refine the 6D pose coming from any pose estimation algorithm by exploiting depth measurements. It addresses the _dimension variability problem_ which affects the RGB-only based neural networks when objects of variable dimension have to be inferred. It solves the problem by setting up a geometric optimization problem. For more details, see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15856).

## Description
The node exposes a python ROS2 service with the following interface:  
* ***inputs***: estimated object pose, depth frame values from rgb-d camera, cad model of recongized object (models folder)
* ***outputs***: refined object pose, scaling factor of the target object

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The ROS2 node (python 3.10) requires the python module NVISII (https://github.com/owl-project/NVISII), which is available only for python <= 3.8. For compatibility reasons, you can use a conda environment as described below, else skip to 3) after installing NVISII.

1) Install conda [instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).

2) Setup the conda environment and all the required packages. 
You can directly create the conda environment using the environment.yaml file:
  ```diff
  source setup_environment.sh
  ```
Alternativly, follow these steps:

2.1) Setup conda environment 
```diff
conda create --name py_depth_opt python=3.8
conda activate py_depth_opt
```

2.2) Install some required packages on python38 env
```diff
conda install -n py_depth_opt pip numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

2.3) Install NVISII
```diff
pip install nvisii
```

2.4) Update python
```diff
conda update python
```

***NOTE***

If you use a virtual environment as conda, note that you have to correctly set the ROS2 variable $PYTHONPATH. Following the procedure described in https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#saving-environment-variables, export the variable in the virtual environment by using
```diff
export PYTHONPATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
```

---

3) Run the node

Once the conda environemnt is created and the PYTHONPATH correctly set (if necessary), you can run the node:
```diff
conda activate py_depth_opt
ros2 launch depth_optimization depth_optimizer.launch.py 
```

---
The depth optimizer node depends on several parameters that can be set through the parameters.yaml file in the config folder. Moreover, the two parameters "mesh_path" and "mesh_scale", can be dinamically changed through the cli (ros2 param set) or by code. 

You can launch a simple client node with
```diff
ros2 run depth_optimization simple_depth_optimizer_client 
```
